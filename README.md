This program  emulates a simple banking system where banking staff are registered and requires password to acccess the system,.

Once a staff is logged in, he can create an account, check for existing accounts numbers and pull their record and also logs out after completing his work.

tho the program is supposed to log the activities  of every staff that logs in, but i was unable to implement that.
